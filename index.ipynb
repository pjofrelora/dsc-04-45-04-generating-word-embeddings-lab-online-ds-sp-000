    "# Generating Word Embeddings - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll learn how to generate our own word embeddings by training our own Word2Vec model, and also by building embedding layers right into our Deep Neural Networks!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonstrate a basic understanding of the architecture of the Word2Vec model\n",
    "* Demonstrate an understanding of the various tunable parameters of word2vec such as vector size and window size\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll start by creating our own word embeddings by making use of the Word2Vec Model. Then, we'll move onto building Neural Networks that make use of **_Embedding Layers_** to accomplish the same end-goal, but directly in our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to make use of Word2Vec is to import it from the [Gensim Library](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). This model contains a full implementation of Word2Vec, which we can use to begin training immediately. For this lab, we'll be working with the [News Category Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset/version/2#_=_).  This dataset contains headlines and article descriptions from the news, as well as categories for which type of article they belong to.  In this lab, we'll learn how to train a Word2Vec model on the text data to generate word embeddings for them. In the next lab, we'll then use the vectors created by our Word2Vec model to effectively train a classifier to predict the category of news given the headline and description of each article. In this lab, we won't do any classification, although we will learn how to train a Word2Vec model and explore the relationships between different word vectors in our embedding!\n",

By doing this for every piece of text in the entire dataset, the Word2Vec model learns excellent vector representations for each word in an **_Embedding Space_**, where the relationships between vectors capture semantic meaning (recall the vector that captures gender in the previous \"king - man + woman = queen\" example we saw).\n",

As we can see from the word in first place, 'reminiscent', our model is far from perfect. This is likely because we didn't give it too much training, or training data. However, for the small amount of training data it was given, the model still performs remarkably well! \n",

There's not really any benefit from training the model ourselves, unless our text uses different, specialized vocabulary that isn't likely to be well represented inside an open-source model.\n",
